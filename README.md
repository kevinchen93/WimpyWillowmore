# Mock-up Web Page Project

This purpose of this project was build a mock-up web page using Bootstrap and JQuery.

This is a project from [Udacity](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css).


## Pre-Project Thoughts

Note: At this point I only have basic HTML, CSS, Chrome Dev Tool, and Git skills.
I will do my best!

## Post-Project Thoughts

This was a good start to my career as a developer!
One thing the page is definitely missing is responsive design.
I will learn that later on in the curriculum.

Skills I demonstrated at project end: <br>
-HTML <br>
-CSS  <br>
-Use of Chrome Developer Tools <br>
-Use of an established framework <br>
	-Familiarity with Bootstrap <br>
-Use of a modal <br>
-Familiarity with JQuery
